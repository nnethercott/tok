# ðŸª™ toktokenizer
toktokenizer is a [BPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) tokenizer implemented in rust and exposed in python using [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) bindings. 

```python 
import toktokenizer as tok
bpe = tok.BPETokenizer.from_pretrained("wikibpe.json")
assert bpe.decode(bpe.encode("rust is pretty fun ðŸ¦€"))
```

Install `toktokenizer` from PyPI with the following
```
pip install toktokenizer
```
**Note:** make sure you have Rust installed to build from the sdist
